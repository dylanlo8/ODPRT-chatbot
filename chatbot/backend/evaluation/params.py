    """The Office of the Deputy President (Research & Technology) issues a monthly newsletter that lists funding opportunities available to NUS researchers.

Researchers may visit NUS’ grant call portal, InfoReady, to view details of open grant calls.

NUS also offers internal programmes such as Humanities and Social Science Fellowships and Start-Up Grants to help new staff kick-off and build their research base at NUS.

Since many grantors strongly discourage researchers from submitting a single proposal to multiple funding agencies for funding consideration, PIs should make a calculated decision before sending in their applications.

For help, please contact the officer in charge of the programme.

    """Research funding awarded to NUS staff and hosted by NUS may be conveyed:
•	Through online portals and grant management systems (e.g. NRF’s IGMS, A*STAR’s iGrants, NIE ROMS, etc.)
•	Via email in softcopy – Letter of Awards, Funding Agreements
The Grant Award Letter or Funding Agreement details the Host Institution and PI/Co-PI’s responsibilities, project milestones/deliverables/key performance indicators, reporting (research performance and financial) requirements and amount of funding awarded. PIs must understand and accept the terms and conditions specified in the Award Letter/Funding Agreement as they are responsible for the overall project and management of the grant.

ODPRT will guide the PI on how to go about accepting the grant. Some programmes may require the PI to scrub the approved budget before the grantor releases the formal Letter of Award.

    """Multiple WBS accounts for a single grant are exceptions rather than the norm. The identification of co-PI(s) in a grant proposal does not immediately justify the creation of multiple WBS accounts. The Lead PI (as named in the official Letter of Award or Funding Agreement) who wishes to request for multiple WBS accounts for better management of the grant, or to sub-award part of the main grant to co-PI(s) overseeing specific work packages must submit a formal request to Director, Research Administration, ODPRT, through the Department and VDR/Director. The request must discuss the following in detail:
1.	What is the impact in terms of administrative ease for both the PI and administrators?
2.	What is the feasible arrangement proposed by the PI to ensure a real reduction in administrative effort for both PIs and administrators?
3.	What is the PI's proposed workflow and formalised procedure to mitigate risk and ensure proper monitoring of funds to guard against unauthorised use?
4.	How will PI maintain overall control over fund utilisation for all WBS accounts to ensure expenses adhere to the T&Cs of the grantor and Agreement?
Only requests that are strongly supported by the Faculty/RIC/RCE and have addressed all relevant areas will be assessed. Note that if the grantor declines to reimburse NUS for expenses incurred due to violation of the grant’s terms and conditions, the PI and/or host Department/Faculty/RIC/RCE may be required to bear the cost of the rejected claims.

PIs are reminded that they are fully accountable for the overall project and utilisation of the total grants awarded. This duty does not diminish with the sub-division of the grant and PIs are responsible for the entire grant, including the portions sub-awarded to their co-PI(s). Research grants awarded for a single project administered in multiple WBS accounts are governed by the same terms & conditions and remain the sole responsibility of the PI who accepted the grant.

For help, please contact the officer in charge of the programme.

    """PIs are required to submit annual progress reports to grantors to update them on the progress of their research. PIs should refer to the respective grant programme for the details and form in which these are submitted.

Please contact the officer in charge of the programme. 
""",
    """In consideration of the increased risk of payment defaults, PIs/Faculties/Departments/Research Institutes/Centres are required to seek advance payment from the non-government organisation either in full or in progressive stages ahead of milestone deliverables.

The requirement for advance payment must be incorporated into the agreements with non-government organisations. PIs must ensure that work related to a particular milestone does not commence until NUS has received the advance payment for that milestone in full.

To mitigate the risk of payment defaults, the budget reflected in project accounts created to manage grants from non-government organisations and industry funders will be based on the actual cash received from the external party.

Waiver of advance payment requires the prior approval of the Deputy President (Research & Technology). Requests for such waivers must be accompanied by justifications from the PI, HOD and VDR/Centre Director. In the event of a payment default, the PI, Department and Faculty/Centre will be required to bear the costs incurred.

Advance payment is not required for grants received directly (not through subawards) from the following agencies/organisations:
•	Singapore governmental organisations (e.g. PUB, NParks, EDB, MINDEF, etc.)
•	Singapore public sector organisations (e.g. various entities under National Health Group, SingHealth and National University Health Systems, Research Institutes under A*STAR, etc.)
•	Charities and non-profit organisations
